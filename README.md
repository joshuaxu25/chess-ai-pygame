# Chess AI PyGame

This project is a chess engine that allows players to play chess.  

The engine also allows you to play against an AI that has been programmed using algorithms such as negamax, alpha-beta pruning, and min-max.

The project was built using PyGame, Python, & OOP.

# To Play
1. Download the repository.
2. Install PyGame by typing `pip install pygame` in your terminal. If you are using Mac, type `pip3 install pygame`.

3. Set the players to either `True` or `False` where:
    - `True`: Human Player
    - `False`: Computer Player
   If you set both players to `False`, two computers will play against each other.
4. Run `ChessEngine.py`.
